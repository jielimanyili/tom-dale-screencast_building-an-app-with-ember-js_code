Code includes Ember client and REST Service API

This is a great video from Tom Dale. I followed it and created two small projects:
- bloggr-client: this is the Ember.js app
- bloggr-rest-service: this is a CORS-enabled RESTful API (I built with Grails, but this could be built with any preferred language. Just to make sure it supports CORS)
