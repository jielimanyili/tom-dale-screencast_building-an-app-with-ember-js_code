Source code for Tom Dale's screencast: [Building an App with Ember-js](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=Ga99hMi7wfY)
======================================================

Includes Ember client and REST Service API

This is a great video from Tom Dale. I followed it and created two small projects:
- bloggr-client: this is the Ember.js app
- bloggr-rest-service: this is a CORS-enabled RESTful API (I built with Grails, but this could be built with any preferred language. Just to make sure it supports CORS)
